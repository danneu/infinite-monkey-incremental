    <!-- Briefing -->

    <p>
      You are an underpaid underwriter for Dan Brown novels, and you've had enough
      of the low pay and the soul-sucking work. Last week at the water
      cooler, your co-worker Chuck, at his wit's end, makes the joke
      "even a monkey could please our editors", and it gives you your next big idea:
    </p>
    <p>
      It's time to subcontract.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carving out some space in your corner of the Dan Brown underwriter
      sweatshop, you set up little desks with little chairs that slide under
      little typewriters. You save up enough to buy your first monkey and put it
      to work on the next Dan Brown book...
